# APB-lite property catalog

The bridge from spec → checker. Every assertion in `formal/fapb.sv` must trace to a row here;
every in-scope row here must become an assertion. Rows are de-duplicated from the spec
(IHI0024E, captured in [`IHI0024E.md`](IHI0024E.md)), cross-checked against open-source VIPs
and ZipCPU's `fapb_slave.v`.

## Legend

- **Drives** — who drives the signals the rule constrains: **R** = Requester, **C** = Completer.
  In a **Completer-checker**, R-rows are `assume` (legal stimulus) and C-rows are `assert`
  (the DUT's obligations). In a **Requester-checker**, the macro flip reverses this. (ADR 0003.)
- **Scope** — ✅ in scope (APB-lite + APB3) · ⬜ out of scope (APB4/APB5, parameterized off, ADR 0002).
- **Cite** — section/figure of IHI0024E.

Notation in encodings: `p` = `$past`, `$rose/$fell/$stable` as in SVA; all sampled at
`posedge PCLK`, `disable iff (!PRESETn)`. `sel=PSEL`, `en=PENABLE`, `rdy=PREADY`.

## Safety properties

| # | Property | Cite | Scope | Drives | Encoding sketch |
|---|----------|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| P1 | **Reset → idle.** While/just after reset, `!PSEL && !PENABLE`. | §4, App B defaults | ✅ | R | `!PRESETn \|⇒ !sel && !en` (and initial). |
| P2 | **Setup has enable low.** The first selected cycle of a transfer has `PENABLE` low. | §3.1, §4 | ✅ | R | `$rose(sel) \|-> !en`  (more precisely: `sel && !p(sel) \|-> !en`). |
| P3 | **Setup lasts one cycle → access.** A setup cycle (`sel && !en`) is always followed by an access cycle (`sel && en`). | §4 | ✅ | R | `sel && !en \|⇒ sel && en`. |
| P4 | **No enable without select.** `PENABLE \|-> PSEL`. | §4 (ACCESS has PSEL=1) | ✅ | R | `en \|-> sel`.  *(VIP gap — neither surveyed VIP asserts this.)* |
| P5 | **Access holds until ready.** In access with `PREADY` low, stay in access next cycle. | §3.1.2, §3.3.2, §4 | ✅ | R | `sel && en && !rdy \|⇒ sel && en`. |
| P6 | **Enable deasserts on completion.** A completing access (`sel && en && rdy`) is followed by `!PENABLE`. | §3.1, §4 | ✅ | R | `sel && en && rdy \|⇒ !en`.  (≡ `en == !p(rdy)` while selected.) |
| P7 | **PADDR stable through transfer.** `PADDR` is held from setup until the transfer completes. | §3.1.2, §3.3.2, §4 | ✅ | R | `p(sel) && !(p(en)&&p(rdy)) \|-> $stable(PADDR)`. |
| P8 | **PWRITE stable through transfer.** As P7 for `PWRITE`. | §3.1.2, §3.3.2, §4 | ✅ | R | `p(sel) && !(p(en)&&p(rdy)) \|-> $stable(PWRITE)`. |
| P9 | **PWDATA stable through write transfer.** As P7 for `PWDATA` when `PWRITE`. | §3.1.2, §4 | ✅ | R | `p(sel)&&p(PWRITE) && !(p(en)&&p(rdy)) \|-> $stable(PWDATA)`. |
| P10 | **PADDR valid (not X) when selected.** | App A | ✅ | R | `sel \|-> !$isunknown(PADDR)`. |
| P11 | **PREADY valid when selected & enabled.** | App A | ✅ | C | `sel && en \|-> !$isunknown(rdy)`. |
| P12 | **PRDATA valid on completing read.** | App A | ✅ | C | `sel && en && rdy && !PWRITE \|-> !$isunknown(PRDATA)`. |
| P13 | **PSLVERR only on completing access.** `PSLVERR` may be HIGH only when `PSEL && PENABLE && PREADY`. | §3.4 | ✅ | C | `PSLVERR \|-> sel && en && rdy`.  *(VIP gap as SVA.)* |
| P14 | **PSLVERR low otherwise** *(recommended)*. | §3.4 ("recommended, not required") | ✅* | C | `!(sel&&en&&rdy) \|-> !PSLVERR`. Gated by `F_OPT_SLVERR_STRICT` (recommendation, not a hard rule). |
| P15 | **PSTRB low on reads.** | §3.2 | ⬜ | R | `sel && !PWRITE \|-> PSTRB == 0`. Behind `F_OPT_PSTRB`. |
| P16 | **PSTRB/PPROT/PWDATA-lanes stable through access.** | §4 | ⬜ | R | `$stable(PSTRB)`, `$stable(PPROT)` in the P7 window. Behind `F_OPT_PSTRB`/`F_OPT_PPROT`. |

\* P14 is in scope but **assert-only when the strict knob is set**, because the spec marks it a
recommendation, not a requirement.

## Liveness / forward-progress

| # | Property | Cite | Scope | Drives | Encoding sketch |
|---|----------|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| L1 | **Bounded stall (liveness proxy).** Once in access, `PREADY` goes HIGH within `F_OPT_MAXSTALL` cycles. | §3 (transfers complete); no hard bound in spec | ✅ | C | counter on `sel && en && !rdy`; `assert(count < F_OPT_MAXSTALL)`. A *safety encoding* of "every transfer eventually completes" — see ADR 0001. |
| L2 | **Two-cycle minimum.** Every transfer occupies ≥2 cycles (setup + access). | §1 | ✅ | — | Emergent from P2+P3; assert via cover, not a standalone obligation. |

## Cover scenarios (reachability — prove the checker isn't vacuous)

| # | Scenario | Cite |
|---|----------|------|
| C1 | Completed write, no wait states | Fig 3-1 |
| C2 | Completed read, no wait states | Fig 3-4 |
| C3 | Transfer with ≥1 wait state | Fig 3-2 / 3-5 |
| C4 | Transfer completing with `PSLVERR` | Fig 3-6 / 3-7 |
| C5 | Back-to-back transfers (no IDLE between: access → setup) | §3.1, §4 |
| C6 | Transfer then return to IDLE | §4 |

## Notes on rules that are *stronger than the spec* (do not adopt as universal)

Surveyed VIPs encode two invariants the AMBA spec does **not** require — keep them only as
optional, design-specific checks, never as core protocol asserts:

- "All control/data are zero in IDLE (`!PSEL`)." The spec only requires `PSEL` deasserted and
  *recommends* (App A) driving unused signals to zero — it does not mandate it.
- "All signals `$fell` the cycle after completion." The spec requires `PENABLE` deassert
  (P6) and `PSEL` deassert unless another transfer follows — not a synchronized fall of every
  signal.
